        <div class="title-layout">
            <p class="title-detail"> Following World War II, the Soviet Union and the United States engaged in a
                struggle to prove their superiority. The Cold War constituted nearly fifty years of physical battles,
                technological advancements, and diplomatic engagements. By 1960, the battles extended beyond Earth’s
                gravity. Space became another avenue of competition because of the prospect of atmospheric control and
                the undeniable message it sent to the international community. National leaders from both countries
                recognized the opportunity of space exploration from a political perspective and began heavily funding
                missions. Dominance in the skies was far more important than land battles; it was a way to prove
                unchallenged superiority to the entire world. From the beginning, the Space Race was an extension of
                this ideological battle between the two nations. Space became the final frontier for the United States
                and Soviet Union to compete to prove their status as sole superpower.</p>

                            <p>The Soviet Union’s first spacecraft launch changed the world overnight. Sputnik was the
                                first artificial satellite to enter the atmosphere and passed over the United States
                                multiple times daily. The world had never seen this technology, and the possibilities
                                and dangers were endless, sparking fear across the globe. Sputnik is largely considered
                                to be the “starting point” of the Space Race because of its effect on both countries’
                                national agendas.</p>

                            <p>Laika, the dog from the USSR, made history by becoming the first live organism launched
                                into space. The Soviets launched Sputnik II less than a month after its predecessor to
                                learn about the effects of space on animals and the conditions under which they could
                                survive. Unfortunately, Laika’s trip was designed to be one way. She died shortly after
                                takeoff due to the stress of the launch.</p>

                            <p>This was the first successful crewed mission to orbit the moon, turning the tide of the
                                Space Race. These astronauts took photos that were immensely helpful to the Apollo 11
                                landing preparation.</p>
